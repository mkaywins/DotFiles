# coc-fsharp: F# Language Server for coc.nvim

This project is a language server extension for coc.nvim.

Originally, this project started from [another F# language server](https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharp-language-server) but I find it hard to keep up with the changes. Now this project is essentially a thin wrapper around [FSAutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/fsautocomplete).

# Installation
- You'll need [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) installed first.
- Check `:set ft=` and if the result is not "fsharp", it doesn't trigger plugin initialization. Use something like https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot
- Run `:CocInstall coc-fsharp`

# Troubleshooting
- Feel free to open issues if you have problems.
- The more information I have, the better I diagnose.
- Usually I'll need:
  - `:CocInfo`
  - ~~`project_root/obj/project.assets.json`~~
    - Problems related to FSAC will not be supported here.
